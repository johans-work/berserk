# Intro
Berserk is a keyboard layout optimized for the mouse and minimum finger travel, compatible with virtually any keyboard. Berserk isn't so much original as it is inevitable for anyone with similar requirements. Save time by starting with many of the answers first. I've also written an [https://github.com/johans-work/custom-keyboards-overview/tree/main](overview of custom keyboards).

# The Answers, First

- [ ] ; is replace with ' that has higher usage.
- [ ] To eliminate the number row at 2u distance, Layer 1 is added for numbers.
- [ ] A numpad layout allows for all numbers to be accessible by the left hand.
- [ ] Navigation arrows are used when not using the mouse, so are added to the right hand side of Layer 1.
- [ ] Navigation arrows are added at H J K L after standard VIM motions. 
- [ ] Layer 2 is added for symbols.
- [ ] The symbols paired with number keys remain paired occupying the same position as their numbers.
- [ ] - _ = + are added to T B G R on the left of layer 2.
- [ ] ; and : are placed above , and . at K L on the left of layer 2.
- [ ] ` is place at ' and ~ above it at P on the left of layer 2.  
- [ ] () are added at H J, {} at Y U, and [] at I O on the left of layer 2. 
- [ ] | and \ are added to N and M on the left of layer 2.
- [ ] < > ? remain at their positions on layer 2.
- [ ] Layer 3 is added for Fn keys, with the same numpad layout.

With the above, all input keys have been laid out with plenty of empty keys for further customizations.
Next are the mod keys, which are more dependent on the physical key positions.

The following works best with a split layout such as Alice and most split keyboards that have at least 2 left thumb keys and 1 right thumb key. It also assumes there is no number row, and possibly no ctrl key below shift, as with HHKB style layouts. Therefore, there are only 3 mod keys to work with / worry about.

- [ ] Caps lock is replaced with ctrl on hold and tab on tap, after the HHKB layout.
- [ ] Tab is replaced with win on hold and del on tap.
- [ ] Left shift is replaced with alt on hold and esc on tap.
- [ ] The main left thumb key is replaced with enter on tap, and shift on hold.
- [ ] The second left thumb key is replaced with backspace on tap, and Layer 1 on hold.
- [ ] The main right thumb key is replaced with space on tap and layer 1 on hold.

To adapt the above to standard keyboards with just one spacebar at the thumb:

- [ ] The right hand shift, enter, and backspace remain at their positions.
- [ ] Space is replaced with space on tap and shift on hold.

# Determining Factors

- [ ] Whether you use your mouse a lot.
- [ ] Whether you rely on classic shortcut keys for copy and paste, photoshop, or vim, etc.
- [ ] Whether you even use function keys at all.
- [ ] Whether you prefer similar keys grouped on one hand or split across both.
- [ ] Whether you code.
- [ ] Your keyboard.


# Some History

I started with the ZSA Voyager, and though the column staggered keys were not that big of an adjustment, figuring out the layers was. What do you even do with 4 thumb keys and 10 layers?

Lesson one: **"Being told what to do is easy. Choice is what's hard."**

But don't damn your freedom. It's what ensures you'll get to a better place!

# A Few Misconceptions

### 1. "Smaller keyboards have less keys."

Physical keys, yes, but every new layer multplies the physical key count. So a 40% keyboard with 3 layers is a 120% keyboard.
   
### 2. "Layers are difficult."

Shift is a layer, as are ctrl, alt, fn, and win, that just give another input for various keys. What's difficult is figuring out what to put on new layers, and how to trigger them. Choice is what's hard.

### 3. "QWERTY sucks, I also should learn a new layout."

Yes, QWERTY is not the most efficient when considering key usage and travel distance. However, most of your wrist twisting and bad posture are not the result of how your alpha keys are laid out, which are all 1u distance from the homerow. 

And the results of the clinical trials conducted by "the internet" are fairly unanomous. After months of productivity loss as you switch, most end up slower than QWERTY, which you'd think would be impossible given they're scientifically proven to be more efficient. This isn't to say you shouldn't do it. Just, do everything else first, especially if your primary concern is ergonomics.


# Why Now?

New layouts such as Berserk have become possible thanks to the popularity of new firmware that enables easy customization of layers and key functions; namely QMK, and it's derivatives VIA and VIAL.
