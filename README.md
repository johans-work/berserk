# berserk
A keyboard layout optimized for 1u maximum travel distance and mouse use compatible with virtually any keyboard.

Berserk isn't so much original as it is inevitable for anyone like me who uses the mouse a lot, wants to maximize left hand usefulness, and owns a lot of keyboards (or soon to own a lot of keyboards). Add to this the ergonomic benefits of minimal finger travel and splitness, the modern keyboard features, and some of the constraints imposed by pre-existing conditions, and you'll end up with berserk, if not something similar.

So if anything, bererk will save you a lot of time. Skip ahead in your journey of layout customization, and start where I've ended, with all the design decisions laid out for you to pick and choose from.


# some history

My split journey started with the ZSA Voyager. 

The column staggared layout was not that big of an adjustment, but figuring out the layers was.
