# berserk
Berserk is a keyboard layout template optimized for 1u maximum travel distance and mouse use compatible with virtually any keyboard.

Berserk isn't so much original as it is inevitable for anyone like me who uses the mouse a lot, wants to maximize left hand usefulness, and owns a lot of keyboards (or soon to own a lot of keyboards). Add to this the ergonomic benefits of minimal finger travel and splitness, modern keyboard features, and some of the constraints imposed by pre-existing conditions, and you'll end up with something similar to berserk.

So if anything, bererk will save you time. 

Skip ahead in your custom layout journey, and start where someone left off, with the design decisions laid out for you to understand and choose from.


# some history

I started with the ZSA Voyager. The column staggared key layout was not that big of an adjustment, but figuring out the layers was. Where do you even start when anything is possible? What do you do with 2 thumb keys on both hands?
