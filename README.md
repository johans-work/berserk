# berserk
A keyboard layout optimized for 1u maximum travel distance and mouse use compatible with virtually any keyboard.

Berserk isn't so much original as it is inevitable for anyone who uses the mouse a lot, and wants to maximize the use of their left hand. Add to this the ergonomic benefits of minimal finger travel and splitness, the modern tools available to enhance keyboard features, and some of the constraints imposed by pre-existing conditions. 



# history

My split journey started with the ZSA Voyager. It was the latest split keyboard with great build quality and software by the makers of the Moonlander and ErodoxEZ.
