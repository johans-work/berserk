# Intro
Berserk is a univeral ergonomic keyboard layout for programmable keyboards, that also offers a sensible default for split and 40%.

requirements:

- [ ] dual function keys and layers (offered by programmable firmware such as VIA/VIAL).

features:

- [ ] no finger travel (max 1u / 1 key)
- [ ] good with any keyboard
- [ ] great with the mouse
- [ ] no dedicated mod keys
- [ ] good with mod combinations
- [ ] arrow keys on homerow
- [ ] homerow mods optional except for the A key
- [ ] room for big spacebars for sound
- [ ] ample free keys

Most programmable keyboards don't come with layout instructions, and though solving puzzles are fun, this can obstruct your real work. Get a running start with berserk, or grab whatever works for you. Berserk isn't so much original as it is inevitable for anyone with similar requirements. I've also written a [custom keyboard guide](https://github.com/johans-work/custom-keyboard-guide). 

## phase 1: eliminate all mod, num, and fn keys

- [ ] We adopt the hhkb ctrl position at caps lock, and swap caps lock with tab on tap, ctrl on hold.
- [ ] If you only have one space bar, swap it with space on tap, shift on hold.
- [ ] If you have two space bars, swap left space with enter on tap, shift on hold, and right spacebar with space on tap, layer1 on hold.
- [ ] With the shift key free, swap left shift with esc on tap, alt on hold.
- [ ] With the esc key free, swap esc with del on tap, win on hold.
- [ ] layer1 is added for numbers, layer2 for symbols, and layer3 for function keys.

For regular keyboards with only one spacebar, shift is added to the spacebar, with enter and backspace remaining at their standard positions. With a split spacebar, both enter and backspace can be assigned to the left hand side, which works great with the mouse.

## phase 2: multiply by 4

Layers multiply key count. A 40% keyboard with 4 layers already gives you 160%, with no finger travel.

- [ ] The symbols on number keys remain paired at the same position on the symbol layer.

## phase 3: the rest

- [ ] Layer2 is added for symbols.

- [ ] - _ = + are added to T B G R on the left of layer 2. Equal is in the middle, with underscore below it, and minus above it, with plus next to minus at the 9 position.
- [ ] ; is replace with ' that has higher usage on layer0.
- [ ] ; and : are placed above , and . at K L on the left of layer 2.
- [ ] ` is place at ' and ~ above it at P on the left of layer 2.  
- [ ] () are added at H J, {} at Y U, and [] at I O on the left of layer 2. 
- [ ] | and \ are added to N and M on the left of layer 2. With Alice layouts, / is added to the spair key to the left of N.
- [ ] < > ? remain at their positions on layer 2.

## optional configurations

Next are the mod keys. They are merged into tap and hold dual function keys to the leftmost column and thumb row.

- [ ] We are assuming at least two left thumb keys, and one right thumb key.
- [ ] The main right thumb key is replaced with space on tap, and layer 1 (numbers) on hold.
- [ ] The main left thumb key is replaced with enter on tap, and shift on hold.
- [ ] With shift at the thumb, caps lock and shift keys become redundant.
- [ ] Caps lock is replaced with ctrl on hold after the popular HHKB layout, and tab on tap, for tab to be in the middle of the column.
- [ ] Between left shift and the original tab key, we can distribute alt, win, del, and esc.
- [ ] To avoid accidentally hitting del, we move it to the top of the column at the original tab key position, and therefore esc goes to left shift.
- [ ] The original tab on hold, and alt to left shift.
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] The second left thumb key is replaced with backspace on tap, and Layer 1 on hold.
- [ ] The main right thumb key is replaced with space on tap and layer 1 on hold.

To adapt the above to standard keyboards with just one spacebar at the thumb:

- [ ] The right hand shift, enter, and backspace remain at their positions.
- [ ] Space is replaced with space on tap and shift on hold.

# Determining Factors

- [ ] Whether you use your mouse a lot.
- [ ] Whether you rely on classic shortcut keys for copy and paste, photoshop, or vim, etc.
- [ ] Whether you even use function keys at all.
- [ ] Whether you prefer similar keys grouped on one hand or split across both.
- [ ] Whether you code.
- [ ] Your keyboard.



# Why Now?

New layouts such as Berserk have become possible thanks to the popularity of new firmware that enables easy customization of layers and key functions; namely QMK, and it's derivatives VIA and VIAL.
