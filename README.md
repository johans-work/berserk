# Intro
Berserk is a keyboard layout optimized for the mouse and minimum finger travel, compatible with virtually any keyboard. Berserk isn't so much original as it is inevitable for anyone with similar requirements. Save time by starting with many of the answers first.

# The Answers, First

- [x] The number row at 2u distance is eliminated. Layer 1 is added for numbers.
- [ ] A numpad layout on the left allows for all numbers to be used while the right hand is occupied by the mouse.
- [ ] On the right of layer 1, we add the navigation arrows at H J K L after classic VIM motions.
- [ ] Layer 2 is added for symbols. The symbols paired with the numbers can remain paired with the numpad layout, except for 9 and 0 which are parentheses.
- [ ] On the left of layer 2, we add the remaining symbols, with 

- [x] Arrows, a navigation layer is added.


# Main Factors



# Some History

I started with the ZSA Voyager, and though the column staggered keys were not that big of an adjustment, figuring out the layers was. What do you even do with 4 thumb keys and 10 layers?

Lesson one: **"Being told what to do is easy. Choice is what's hard."**

But don't damn your freedom. It's what ensures you'll get to a better place!

# A Few Misconceptions

### 1. "Smaller keyboards have less keys."

Physical keys, yes, but every new layer multplies the physical key count. So a 40% keyboard with 3 layers is a 120% keyboard.
   
### 2. "Layers are difficult."

Shift is a layer, as are ctrl, alt, fn, and win, that just give another input for various keys. What's difficult is figuring out what to put on new layers, and how to trigger them. Choice is what's hard.

### 3. "QWERTY sucks, I also should learn a new layout."

Yes, QWERTY is not the most efficient when considering key usage and travel distance. However, most of your wrist twisting and bad posture are not the result of how your alpha keys are laid out, which are all 1u distance from the homerow. 

And the results of the clinical trials conducted by "the internet" are fairly unanomous. After months of productivity loss as you switch, most end up slower than QWERTY, which you'd think would be impossible given they're scientifically proven to be more efficient. This isn't to say you shouldn't do it. Just, do everything else first, especially if your primary concern is ergonomics.


# Why Now?

New layouts such as Berserk have become possible thanks to the popularity of new firmware that enables easy customization of layers and key functions; namely QMK, and it's derivatives VIA and VIAL.
