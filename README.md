# berserk
Berserk is a keyboard layout template optimized for 1u maximum travel distance and mouse use compatible with virtually any keyboard of any shape or size.

Berserk isn't so much original as it is inevitable for anyone like me who uses the mouse a lot, wants to maximize left hand usefulness, and owns a lot of keyboards (or soon to own a lot of keyboards). Add to this the ergonomic benefits of minimal finger travel and splitness, modern keyboard features, and constraints imposed by pre-existing conditions, and, I promise, you'll end up with something similar to berserk.

So if anything, bererk is just to save you time. Start where someone left off, with the design decisions laid out for you to understand and choose from.


# some history

I started with the ZSA Voyager, and though the column staggered keys were not that big of an adjustment, figuring out the layers was. What do you even do with 4 thumb keys and 10 layers? Which brings me to the first lesson of a keyboard enthuseist. 

"Being told what to do is easy. Choice is what's hard."

But don't damn your freedom! It's what ensures you'll get to a better place!


# some misconceptions

1. "Smaller keyboards have less keys."
   Physical keys, yes, but every new layer multplies the physical key count. So a 40% keyboard with 3 layers is a 120% keyboard. 
2. "Layers are difficult."
   Shift is a layer, as is ctrl alt and the rest of the mod keys. They give you access to another version of each key. What's difficult is figuring out what to put on new layers, and how to trigger them. Choice is what's hard.
3. "QWERTY sucks, I also need to learn a new layout."
   Yes, QWERTY is not the most energy efficient when considering key usage and travel distance. However, the verdict is in. The upside to learning a completely new layout is
