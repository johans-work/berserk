# Intro
Berserk is a univeral ergonomic keyboard layout for programmable keyboards, that also offers a sensible default for split and 40% keyboards. 

requirements:

- [ ] dual function keys and layers (offered by programmable firmware such as VIA/VIAL).

features:

- [ ] no finger travel (max 1u / 1 key)
- [ ] compatible with any keyboard
- [ ] optimized for mouse use
- [ ] eliminates dedicated mod keys
- [ ] homerow mods optional except for the A key
- [ ] room for at least 1 big spacebar for sound
- [ ] ample free keys

Most programmable keyboards don't come with layout instructions, and though solving puzzles are fun, this can obstructs your real work. Get a running start with berserk, or grab whatever works for you. Berserk isn't so much original as it is inevitable for anyone with similar requirements. I've also written a [custom keyboard guide](https://github.com/johans-work/custom-keyboard-guide). 

## phase 1: eliminate all mod, num, and fn keys

- [ ] We adopt the hhkb ctrl position at caps lock, and swap it with tab on tap, ctrl on hold.
- [ ] If you only have one space bar, swap it with space on tap, shift on hold.
- [ ] If you have two space bars, swap left space with enter on tap, shift on hold, and right spacebar with space on tap, layer1 on hold.
- [ ] With the shift key free, we swap it with esc on tap, alt on hold.
- [ ] With the esc key free, we swap it with del on tap, win on hold.
- [ ] layer1 is added for numbers, layer2 for symbols, and layer3 for function keys.


## phase 2: multiply by 3

Layers multiply key count. A 40% keyboard with 3 layers already gives you 120%, with no finger travel.


## phase 3: the rest

- [ ] Layer2 is added for symbols.
- [ ] The symbols paired with number keys remain paired occupying the same position as their numbers.
- [ ] - _ = + are added to T B G R on the left of layer 2. Equal is in the middle, with underscore below it, and minus above it, with plus next to minus at the 9 position.
- [ ] ; is replace with ' that has higher usage on layer0.
- [ ] ; and : are placed above , and . at K L on the left of layer 2.
- [ ] ` is place at ' and ~ above it at P on the left of layer 2.  
- [ ] () are added at H J, {} at Y U, and [] at I O on the left of layer 2. 
- [ ] | and \ are added to N and M on the left of layer 2. With Alice layouts, / is added to the spair key to the left of N.
- [ ] < > ? remain at their positions on layer 2.

## final analysis

Next are the mod keys. They are merged into tap and hold dual function keys to the leftmost column and thumb row.

- [ ] We are assuming at least two left thumb keys, and one right thumb key.
- [ ] The main right thumb key is replaced with space on tap, and layer 1 (numbers) on hold.
- [ ] The main left thumb key is replaced with enter on tap, and shift on hold.
- [ ] With shift at the thumb, caps lock and shift keys become redundant.
- [ ] Caps lock is replaced with ctrl on hold after the popular HHKB layout, and tab on tap, for tab to be in the middle of the column.
- [ ] Between left shift and the original tab key, we can distribute alt, win, del, and esc.
- [ ] To avoid accidentally hitting del, we move it to the top of the column at the original tab key position, and therefore esc goes to left shift.
- [ ] The original tab on hold, and alt to left shift.
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] The second left thumb key is replaced with backspace on tap, and Layer 1 on hold.
- [ ] The main right thumb key is replaced with space on tap and layer 1 on hold.

To adapt the above to standard keyboards with just one spacebar at the thumb:

- [ ] The right hand shift, enter, and backspace remain at their positions.
- [ ] Space is replaced with space on tap and shift on hold.

# Determining Factors

- [ ] Whether you use your mouse a lot.
- [ ] Whether you rely on classic shortcut keys for copy and paste, photoshop, or vim, etc.
- [ ] Whether you even use function keys at all.
- [ ] Whether you prefer similar keys grouped on one hand or split across both.
- [ ] Whether you code.
- [ ] Your keyboard.



# Why Now?

New layouts such as Berserk have become possible thanks to the popularity of new firmware that enables easy customization of layers and key functions; namely QMK, and it's derivatives VIA and VIAL.
